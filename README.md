# 118W-CAPMobile
This project is used for San Jose State University class 119W. The repository is used for a group project, specifically the design of a website using HTML 5 and CCS3.
The site will be an eCommerce site that offers mobile phones for sale. However, since the site is a class project, no actual purchases will take place.
The site will make use of Bootstrap.
